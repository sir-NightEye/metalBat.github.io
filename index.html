    <p class="text-big">A Hero that everyone admires.</p>
    <p class="text-small">Bad (バッド, Baddo), better known by his hero alias Metal Bat (金きん属ぞくバット, Kinzoku Batto), is the S-Class Rank 15 professional hero of the Hero Association.</p><br>
    <h1 class="headings">Appearance</h1><br>
    <p class="text-small">Metal Bat is a young man with black hair styled in a pompadour, and dark eyes that emphasize his hot temper. He wears black bontan pants and a black Japanese school uniform, which he drapes over his red long-sleeved turtleneck sweater.</p><br>
    <a href="https://onepunchman.fandom.com/wiki/Bad"><img src="img/metalPose.jpg" alt="Metabat Appearance" class="images"></a>
    <h1 class="headings">Personality</h2>
    <p class="text-small middlep">Metal Bat has a great deal of confidence in himself, stating that he does not care whether a threat is a Demon or Dragon level.</sup> He also seems to be brash and reckless, as shown when he immediately smashed one of Melzargard's marbles instead of trying to analyze what purpose it serves for the enemy. Furthermore, he was willing to challenge Sweet Mask for his mocking attitude before being interrupted by a call from his sister and Sweet Mask's manager.<br><br>

        <p class="text-small lastp">As an S-Class hero, Metal Bat is very powerful. Despite his lower rank, he is a powerful and intimidating combatant, threatening Sweet Mask (whose abilities are worthy of S-Class) with no fear, as well as holding his own against Garou.
      
          He is particularly hardy, capable of taking on multiple Demon-level monsters at once even after being drugged by one amid the fight. He has also stood up to dragon-class monsters, managing to cause Elder Centipede considerable pain with his swings. He was also able to fight against Garou in a duel, despite being gravely injured earlier by repeated battles against increasingly powerful enemies. While he was initially unable to do any damage against Sage Centipede, once empowered by his Fighting Spirit, he was capable of cracking Sage Centipede's defenses, which were significantly more durable than Elder Centipede's carapace defenses.</p></div>
